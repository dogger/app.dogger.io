At Dogger, we believe in full transparency. In addition to being committed to a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/dogger">fully open-source codebase<a>, we are also transparent about our pricing model, <a href="https://plausible.io/dogger.io">our traffic</a> and our internal costs.

### Pull Dog runs on AWS Lightsail
<a href="/blog/pull-dog-automatic-docker-test-environments-for-pull-requests" target="_blank">Pull Dog</a> runs on AWS Lightsail. This is also easy to see from the code. 

Now, if you compare the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/pricing">AWS Lightsail prices</a> with the <a href="/#pull-dog">Pull Dog prices</a>, you'll come to the conclusion that our prices are only roughly $1 higher per month for all plans that provide more than one instance in the pool.

#### So how do we earn money?
Amazon only charges us by the hour. This means that if a server runs for 10 minutes, we get charged an hour of use. If the server runs for a month, we get charged for a month. However, the Pull Dog prices are fixed every month, and is based on the *potential maximum amount of open pull requests (servers) you have*.

This ensures that you don't get any unexpected bills from us, and it also means that we only earn anything when *you don't use the servers all the time*. 

We think this is a fair pricing model, and we hope you do too.
